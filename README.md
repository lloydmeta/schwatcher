Schwatcher [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lloydmeta/schwatcher.png?branch=ci/add_travis)](https://travis-ci.org/lloydmeta/schwatcher)
==========

__Note__: Requires Java 7 because the [WatchService API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/WatchService.html) is an essential part of this library.

In short, a library that wraps the [WatchService API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/WatchService.html) of Java 7 and allows callbacks to be registered on both directories and files.

_Maven_ installation support is coming.

Note:

1. Callbacks are registered for specific paths and for directory paths can be registered as recursive so that a single callback is fired when an event occurs inside the directory tree.
2. Callbacks are not checked for uniqueness when registered to a specific path.
3. A specific path can have multiple callbacks, all will be fired.
4. Callbacks are not guaranteed to be fired in any particular order unless if concurrency is set to 1 on the MonitorActor.
5. Any event on a file path will bubble up to its immediate folder path. This means that if both a file and it's parent directory are registered for callbacks, both set of callbacks will be fired.

Example Usage
-------------

```scala
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import com.beachape.filemanagement.MonitorActor
import com.beachape.filemanagement.RegistryTypes._
import com.beachape.filemanagement.Messages._

import java.io.{FileWriter, BufferedWriter}

import java.nio.file.Paths
import java.nio.file.StandardWatchEventKinds._

implicit val system = ActorSystem("actorSystem")
val fileMonitorActor = system.actorOf(MonitorActor(concurrency = 2))

val modifyCallbackFile: Callback = { path => println(s"Something was modified in a file: $path")}
val modifyCallbackDirectory: Callback = { path => println(s"Something was modified in a directory: $path")}

val desktop = Paths get "/Users/lloyd/Desktop"
val desktopFile = Paths get "/Users/lloyd/Desktop/test"

/*
  This will receive callbacks for just the one file
 */
fileMonitorActor ! RegisterCallback(
  ENTRY_MODIFY,
  recursive = false,
  path = desktopFile,
  modifyCallbackFile)

/*
  If desktopFile is modified, this will also receive a callback
  it will receive callbacks for everything under the desktop directory
*/
fileMonitorActor ! RegisterCallback(
  ENTRY_MODIFY,
  recursive = false,
  path = desktop,
  modifyCallbackDirectory)


//modify a monitored file
val writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(desktopFile.toFile))
writer.write("Theres text in here wee!!")
writer.close

// #=> Something was modified in a file: /Users/a13075/Desktop/test.txt
//     Something was modified in a directory: /Users/a13075/Desktop/test.txt
```

Schwatcher [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lloydmeta/schwatcher.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lloydmeta/schwatcher)
==========

__Note__: Requires Java7+ because the [WatchService API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/WatchService.html)
is an essential part of this library.

__TL;DR__ A library that wraps the [WatchService API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/WatchService.html)
of Java7 and allows callbacks to be registered on both directories and files.

As of Java7, the WatchService API was introduced to allow developers to monitor the file system without resorting to an
external library/dependency like [JNotify](http://jnotify.sourceforge.net/). Unfortunately, it requires you to use a loop
that blocks in order to retrieve events from the API and does not have recursion support built-in.

Schwatcher will allow you to instantiate an Akka actor, register callbacks (functions that take a Path and return Unit) to be
fired for certain [Path](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Path.html)s and [event types](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/StandardWatchEventKinds.html)
by sending messages to it, then simply wait for the callbacks to be fired. The goal of Schwatcher is to facilitate the
use of the Java7 API in Scala in a simple way that is in line with the functional programming paradigm.

__As of now, only Scala versions 2.10.x and 2.11.x are supported__

Installation
------------

Add the following to your `build.sbt`

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.beachape.filemanagement" %% "schwatcher" % "0.1.2"
```

If the above does not work because it cannot be resolved, its likely because it hasn't been synced to Maven central yet.
In that case, download a SNAPSHOT release of the same version by adding this to `build.sbt`

```
resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"

libraryDependencies += "com.beachape.filemanagement" %% "schwatcher" % "0.1.2-SNAPSHOT"
```

__Those using Akka 2.1.x__ should stay on 0.0.2 as 0.0.3 onwards uses Akka 2.2.x, which [requires some work to upgrade to](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/project/migration-guide-2.1.x-2.2.x.html).

__Those using Akka 2.2.x__ should stay on 0.0.9 as 0.0.10 onwards uses Akka 2.3.x, which [may require some work to upgrade to](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.0/project/migration-guide-2.2.x-2.3.x.html).

__0.1.0__ brings with it breaking changes on how to register callbacks (see example). Please be aware when upgrading from 0.0.x releases.


Example Usage
-------------

The basic workflow is:

1. Instantiate a MonitorActor
2. Register callbacks by sending RegisterCallback messages to the MonitorActor
3. Carry on

* Optionally, you can un-register _all_ callbacks for a path and event type by sending UnRegisterCallback messages.
* Both RegisterCallback and UnRegisterCallback messages have a recursive argument (be sure to see point 5 in the
  [Caveats section](#caveats)) that triggers recursive registration and un-registration of callbacks for path.


```scala
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import com.beachape.filemanagement.MonitorActor
import com.beachape.filemanagement.RegistryTypes._
import com.beachape.filemanagement.Messages._

import java.io.{FileWriter, BufferedWriter}

import java.nio.file.Paths
import java.nio.file.StandardWatchEventKinds._

implicit val system = ActorSystem("actorSystem")
val fileMonitorActor = system.actorOf(MonitorActor(concurrency = 2))

val modifyCallbackFile: Callback = { path => println(s"Something was modified in a file: $path")}
val modifyCallbackDirectory: Callback = { path => println(s"Something was modified in a directory: $path")}

val desktop = Paths get "/Users/lloyd/Desktop"
val desktopFile = Paths get "/Users/lloyd/Desktop/test"

/*
  This will receive callbacks for just the one file
 */
fileMonitorActor ! RegisterCallback(
  ENTRY_MODIFY,
  None,
  recursive = false,
  path = desktopFile,
  modifyCallbackFile)

/*
  If desktopFile is modified, this will also receive a callback
  it will receive callbacks for everything under the desktop directory
*/
fileMonitorActor ! RegisterCallback(
  ENTRY_MODIFY,
  None,
  recursive = false,
  path = desktop,
  modifyCallbackDirectory)


//modify a monitored file
val writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(desktopFile.toFile))
writer.write("Theres text in here wee!!")
writer.close

// #=> Something was modified in a file: /Users/lloyd/Desktop/test.txt
//     Something was modified in a directory: /Users/lloyd/Desktop/test.txt
```

Caveats
-------

__Above all things__ understand that library relies on the Java7 WatchService API and has the same constraints, limitations,
and behaviours according to the implementation for the version of JVM you're using.

Additional library-specific caveats and notes are:

1. Callbacks are registered for specific paths, and for directory paths, can be registered as recursive so that a single
   callback is fired when an event occurs inside the directory tree.
2. Callbacks are not checked for uniqueness when registered to a specific path.
3. A specific path can have multiple callbacks registered to a file [event types](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/StandardWatchEventKinds.html),
   all will be fired.
4. Callbacks are not guaranteed to be fired in any particular order unless if concurrency is set to 1 on the MonitorActor.
5. Callbacks that are registered with `recursive=true` are not _persistently-recursive_. That is, they do not propagate
   to new files or folders created/deleted after registration. Currently, the plan is to have developers handle this themselves
   in the callback functions.
6. Any event on a file path will bubble up to its immediate parent folder path. This means that if both a file and it's
   parent directory are registered for callbacks, both sets of callbacks will be fired.

As a result of note 6, you may want to think twice about registering recursive callbacks for `ENTRY_DELETE` because if a
directory is deleted within a directory, 2 callbacks will be fired, once for the path registered for the deleted directory
and once for the path registered for the directory above it (its parent directory).
